## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- `Rust 2021`
- `Actix Web` for REST services
- `Yew` for WebAssembly frontend
- `Trunk` for compiling and serving Wasm apps
- `clap` for command-line interfaces
- `image` for image processing
- `wasm-bindgen` for Web interoperability
- Testing with `#[test]` and `cargo test`

---

## ðŸ§  What this portfolio demonstrates

- Ability to design and build idiomatic libraries in Rust
- Mastery of development tools like `clap`, `cargo`, `trunk`
- Good practices in testing, modularity, and documentation
- Ability to develop both APIs and modern Web interfaces with Rust
